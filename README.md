# C++ exercises before starting last year of uni

I've already been introduced to C++ when I was at high school but since a lot of years has passed I preferred revising it a little before studying advanced C++ at the university.

#### Following some tutorials found online I revised C++ basic

### How to browse between files

First, you will find a folder called ['Tutorials-Basics'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82YdDfxhWsCyZLsg_kXhH8sy5ixQNras) there you will find .cpp files you can compile and execute.  
Since I used them just for revising basics I decided not to upload the entire project but only the main files with the code.   
I decided to create a C++ file for each topic in order to have them commented and well organised.

### Files:
limits.cpp contains tests done with size of natural variables, with bundaries of values (numbers) and signed and unsigned variables for better understanding the differences.
