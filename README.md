# C++ exercises before starting last year of uni

I've already been introduced to C++ when I was at high school but since a lot of years has passed I preferred revising it a little before studying advanced C++ at the university.

#### Following some tutorials found online I revised C++ basic

## Usage: 
### How to browse between files

First, you will find a folder called ['Tutorials-Basics'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82YdDfxhWsCyZLsg_kXhH8sy5ixQNras) there you will find .cpp files you can compile and execute.  
Since I used them just for revising basics I decided not to upload the entire project but only the main files with the code.   
I decided to create a C++ file for each topic in order to have them commented and well organised.
There also is another folder called 'Games&Exercises' for other attempts of C++ simple games, exercises or just some basic projects attempts.

### Files:
'Tutorials-Basics':
limits.cpp contains tests done with size of natural variables, with bundaries of values (numbers) and signed and unsigned variables for better understanding the differences.
arrays.cpp contains arrays declaration and how variables are registered in memory

'Games&Exercises':
guessnumber.cpp is a minigame, the user thinks a number and the machine try to guess it by moving upper and lower limit
youguess.cpp this program thinks a number and you have to guess; the software tells you if the number is greater or lower
numbers.cpp is a simple program that plays with an array of numbers and tells you the sum, average and the greatest and lowest numbers
arraysmaths.cpp generates automatically an array of numbers and counts how many numbers are repeated
parallelogram.cpp draws a parallelogram. first attempt at drawing a parallelogram. sides are fixed
rectangle.cpp this program uses more functions than only the main one and calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle and also draws it
