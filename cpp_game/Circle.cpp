    A circle and a square collide if:
    1) the square is completely or a little bit inside the circle: the distance between the edge of the square and the centre of the circle is lower or equal than the radius of the circle
    2) the circle is inside the square: the centre of the circle is inside the square
    3) the circle is inside the square but the centre is outside and the square has no corner inside the circle: check distance between them lower than the radius plus half the size (radius, whole size like diameter), considering the square like a circle

    In case of a cube and a spheres I would do pratically the same but in a 3D environment:
    so first check if the vertex of a corner of the cube is inside the sphere checking the distance with the center of the sphere
    then check if the center of the sphere is inside the cube
    last consider the cube like a sphere with the diameter of the same size of the edge of the cube and compare the distance between them and the sum or the readiuses
